`func NewFdpSelectionRuleOrder(ruleIds []string, ) *FdpSelectionRuleOrder`

NewFdpSelectionRuleOrder instantiates a new FdpSelectionRuleOrder object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

GetRuleIds returns the RuleIds field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetRuleIdsOk

`func (o *FdpSelectionRuleOrder) GetRuleIdsOk() (*[]string, bool)`

GetRuleIdsOk returns a tuple with the RuleIds field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
